            Egypt's history spans over 5,000 years, beginning with its early civilization along the Nile River. The <strong>Old Kingdom</strong> (c. 2686–2181 BCE) is famous for pyramid construction, including the Great Pyramid of Giza. The <strong>Middle Kingdom</strong> (c. 2055–1650 BCE) saw a cultural renaissance, while the <strong>New Kingdom</strong> (c. 1550–1070 BCE) was Egypt's imperial age, with pharaohs like Ramses II. After periods of decline and foreign rule, Egypt became part of the Roman Empire in 30 BCE. In the modern era, Egypt gained independence in 1952 and plays a key role in the Middle East today.
